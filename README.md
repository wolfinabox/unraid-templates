# unraid-templates
Misc community applications for Unraid

## Installing an application
For now:
1. Download the .xml file of the application you'd like to install.
2. Create a directory with the same name as the application (eg: `sillytavern`) at `/config/plugins/community.applications/private/`
3. Upload the XML file to the newly created directory (eg: `/config/plugins/community.applications/private/sillytavern/sillytavern.xml`). ([Source](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/112170-allow-template-repositories-to-be-hosted-from-other-sources/?do=findComment&comment=1021630))
4. From the Apps tab, open the Private Apps category, and see your new application template.
